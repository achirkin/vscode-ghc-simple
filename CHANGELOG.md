## v0.1.1

    - Type query now uses `:all-types` to find the range only, and uses `:type-at` to find the actual type. This replaces the unneededly complex 'type resolver'.
    - ([#14](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/pull/14)) Quote file names more carefully to handle paths with spaces.
